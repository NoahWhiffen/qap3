### Please see below my answers to the assessment questions.

- *How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)*

Problem 1 only took me about an hour and a half, problem 2 and 3 took me about 2 hours each, and problem 4 took me about an hour.

- What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

Not much for this project besides Google.

- Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Not applicable.

- Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

Not applicable.

- Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

I found this project fairly easy and a lot like other projects that we have made in java. I would rate it a 4.5/5. I am confident I could solve a similar problem in the future.
